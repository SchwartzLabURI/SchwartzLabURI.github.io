I am an Assistant Professor at the Univeristy of Rhode Island. I run a dry lab focused on computational evolutionary genetics. My interest is in developing methods to understand evolution, with a particular focus on how we analyze large genomics datasets. I also have an interest in reproducible research and in teaching research skills to students and other researchers.
