Current research project: My postdoctoral research is focused on developing a pipeline for identifying and characterizing duplications in genomes in order to understand their role and evolutionary significance. Currently I am using the eastern oyster as a model organism to design and test the CNV pipeline. 

Interests: I am interested in using computational biology approaches including designing pipelines to analyze various omics data to study evolutionary biology. 
I have research experience in a range of topics including behavioral ecology, microbiology, phylogenetics, invertebrate immunology, host-microbe interaction and most recently structural variation. 
My research areas of interest include comparative immunology, comparative genomics, host-microbe interaction and broadly evolutionary biology. I am also interested in developing industrial applications informed by my research. For example, my dissertation research explains underlying molecular mechanisms and advantages of using probiotics in larviculture of oysters.
