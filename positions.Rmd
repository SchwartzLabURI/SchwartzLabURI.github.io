### Prospective Postdocs

[Available postdoc position in the lab](postdoc.html)

If you are interested in joining my lab as a postdoc, graduate student, or undergraduate student please read through [the research projects](research.html) in the lab, and the expectations and responsibilities below, then email me 1) your curriculum vitae / resume, and 2) one page cover letter describing your research interests and background. 

If you are interested in joining my lab as a graduate student, please contact me by email as early as possible. The deadline for the receipt of completed applications is January 15 for admission to the Fall semester. I accept MS and PhD students through the Biological and Environmental Sciences graduate program (http://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/bes/) in the College of the Environement and Life Sciences, with a specialization in Evolutionary Biology (https://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/bes/emb/) or Cell and Molecular Biology (https://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/bes/cmb/). Support is available through TA and RA positions.

If you're interested in graduate school, show me you have the potential to do well in graduate school. Potential means you can communicate well in your email, you have done research as an undergraduate or graduate student (so you know that’s what you want to do for the next 2-5 years), and you work hard. However, don't feel intimidated by these requests. If you got excited about something you learned in class and haven't done research contact me anyway. I do not require prior programming experience. However, you should expect to do a lot of computational work in the lab, so make sure that spending time computing sounds okay. See [here](https://sukumaranlab.org/resources/computational-skills/#a-modern-robust-object-oriented-and-scaleable-scripting-language-python) for some things you'll learn.

Send your C.V. or resume. It helps me to see your experience. If you don’t know what a C.V. should look like, look at mine. You don’t have to have extensive experience, but I want to see you’ve been working toward your goals in school and research.
